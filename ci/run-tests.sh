# - test-programs: just programs used in tests.
#
# - wasmtime-wasi-nn: mutually-exclusive features that aren't available for all
#   targets, needs its own CI job.
#
# - wasmtime-fuzzing: enabling all features brings in OCaml which is a pain to
#   configure for all targets, so it has its own CI job.
#
# - wasm-spec-interpreter: brings in OCaml which is a pain to configure for all
#   targets, tested as part of the wastime-fuzzing CI job.
#
# - wasmtime-wasi-keyvalue: additional database service dependencies, needs its
#   own CI job.
